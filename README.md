# ratings_history_module
## Description
The Analyst Ratings module displays data and expert recommendations in an accessible and user-friendly UI. The Purchase History module renders a dynamic and individually expanding list of past purchases.    As a potential customer, I want to be able to easily and confidently determine whether I should buy, hold, or sell.   As an existing customer, I want to see my history of past purchases so that I can see that I am making good purchasing decisions and/or improve future decisions. 


## Note
Note: for a proxy server, the compressed webpack bundles (bundle.js.gz and bundle.js.br) can be uploaded to S3 rather than living in the client/dist/.

## Scripts
